## About this game

Playing this game, step by step, you will become a very big expert in solving Mazes by building your own strategies and plans how to cover and solve them. It helps you develop additional and useful mind capabilities by playing an interesting game related with the childhood of many kids worldwide, like Maze is.

## World Map and Enemies

This is our most complex game based on the [Commons2D](https://github.com/MetatransApps/Android_LIB_Commons2D) Android Developers' framework for 2D graphics. On the last game levels, the map becomes huge with many moving sprites. Probably old computer games, from the last century like Warcraft, could be developed to run on this framework as well. I will be happy to support you technically if you decide to give it a try and make experiments with even more complex games than this nice Maze.

## Levels complexity in numbers

On level 1, the squirrel plays in map, which fits in 1 screen of your device and have 19 x 11 = 209 cells. So you have to make 100+ steps with the squirrel in order to complete the level. On level 48 (the last level and the more difficult one), we have a map, which fits in 290 screens of your device! The camera is moving over this map, so in this game we have a moving camera. The map on level 48 contains 339 x 179 = 60681 cells and needs more than 30000 steps to be completed. This level also has 69 enemies (moving sprites), which you could attack and remove from the map. If they touch you before getting removed, than you lose 1 life out of 5 lives (given in the beginning).
