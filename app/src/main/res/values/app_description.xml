Inspired by love to mazes/labyrinths, we created Ð° game for resolving easy to very hard mazes/labyrinths, which are each time different. There are also enemies in some levels, which makes the game more difficult. You can collect acorns and attack the enemies. The goal is to escape the squirrel by finding the key and the exit. Meanwhile, if you collect 3 starts you go to the next level. Can you escape the squirrel?

The game is supporting different playing levels as well as more other features, like:
1. High scores - keeps track of your best result.
2. Supports different color palettes for different tastes.
3. Supports tablets and phones.
4. Increasing difficulties and sizes of mazes/labyrinths.
5. Each time different mazes/labyrinths.

Your feedback and/or review is more than welcome.
