The Squirrel's Maze 2D

Help the Squirrel. Different maze each time. Many levels.

Could you help the squirrel?
Inspired by love to maze, labyrinth, we created Ð° game for resolving easy to very hard maze, labyrinth, which is each time different. There are company in some levels, which makes the game more difficult. You can collect acorns and feed the other animals. The goal is to help the squirrel by finding the key and the exit. Meanwhile, if you collect 3 starts you go to the next level.
Give it a try!
